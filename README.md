# Return of the Fed 

### About ROTF
ROTF is a vaugely Hayek vs. Keynes themed, top down HTML5 shooter.  It is designed as a place to practice programming paradigms, JS and graphics creation and tooling.

It's written mostly in JS, with a little PHP

### Local Testing
With PHP, it can be tested by cloning, and then running:

```console
php -S localhost:1234
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:1234/play.php
